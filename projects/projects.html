        <p>Description: One of my first projects using APIs and JSON data, this script pulls data from the New York City transportation department to create a vizualation marking trends in traffic speeds over the last hour, as well as a general summary showing average speeds by borough. This data required a small amount of cleaning, as some traffic sensors were disconnected from the system and subsequently removed by filtering out their error code. Vizualations were completed using the ggplot2 package.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: As expected, the vizualization typically shows less dense boroughs like Staten Island enjoying faster traffic speeds, while denser boroughs like Manhattan typically has the lowest average traffic speed. An important skew to the data is that sensors are only installed on major roadways, meaning a larger sample size for boroughs with larger traffic arteries.
        Updates: Work is currently being done to integrate sensor coordinates provided by the API into a GIS-style vizualiation in R.</p>

        <p>Description: Given the relative cleanliness of this data as provided by the NYC Open Data Project, I jumped right in to analysis work. <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-harlem-resident-declares-war-on-jingle-happy-mister-softee-man"> Recent incidents</a> have shown increased tensions between gentrifying and existing populations regarding noise levels. I wanted to see if this trend had any true reflections in 311 call data regarding noise complaints. Users can explore the data themselves through the project's central dashboard, using a filtering mechanism that links Tableau's handy native geospatial data handler to charts displaying trends in noise complaints over time. This project also features some relatively interesting charts that I used to explore the different types of charts available in Tableau.</p>

      <p> Carlyle was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. With a deep reverence for traditional Southern hospitality but a lack of the characteristic accent, he cites his upbringing in the “New South” as a major influence on his interests in social justice and urban development. Carlyle is a proud graduate of Myers Park High School, a well-regarded public school that was also attended by his grandmother. There he obtained his International Baccalaureate Diploma, graduating in the top 3% of his class of over 700 students.</p>
      <p> During his eighteen years of living in Charlotte, Carlyle was able to watch his hometown grow exponentially in both population and size. While he enjoyed the benefits of increased local businesses and cultural activities, he also was able to witness first-hand some of the implications of prioritizing economic growth over sustainable urban planning choices. A neighborhood a block from his own fell victim to gentrification, <img src="../cherryton.jpg" id = 'cherry' alt = 'topimg.jpg'>  with new properties catering to upper-middle class professionals replacing some of Charlotte’s most historic working-class homes. He was struck by the speed of such an operation, with whole blocks of houses being demolished in mere weeks and replaced by buildings two or three times larger in size. This prompted him to investigate the conditions that could lead to such a mass displacement of people in such a short time, especially in a city that had a shortage of affordable housing.</p>
      <p>In his sophomore year of high school, Carlyle used list price information obtained from the Mecklenburg County Registrar of Deeds to research changes in housing prices within the neighborhood, identifying key companies in the neighborhood's redevelopment. Using information from the archives of his local library system, he constructed a photographic report that exposed a ‘bait and switch’ operation on the part of some of these developers, as they would make promises to the city and local community to include low-income housing in order to get favorable rezoning policies and purchasing power, and then neglect to follow through on this commitment. The report also featured crudely created maps put together using Google Maps and Microsoft Paint, Carlyle’s first venture into statistical cartography. This project was one of many that helped kindle his interest in using data to achieve a more sustainable, equitable form of growth.</p>
      <p> Over the next few years, Carlyle stepped back from his research to focus on developing his technical skills. Assisted by open-source software, he taught himself QGIS mapping software and the R statistical programming language. He became interested in machine learning and predictive modeling, taking online coursework on modeling in R and Python. These new skills were invaluable in completing the capstone project of his International Baccalaureate Diploma, a research paper focused on evaluating the socioeconomic effects of a commuter rail system in the Charlotte Neighborhood of South End.</p>
    <p> Attracted by its dedicated major to statistical social science research and ambitious student body, Carlyle committed to Columbia University and moved to the Upper West Side in New York City, where he currently resides.<img src="../cu.jpg" id = 'cu'> At Columbia, Carlyle currently sits on the editorial board of the Journal of Politics and Society, a research journal publishing extraordinary social science research by undergraduates from around the world. He is also in the onboarding process for a Research Assistant position within Columbia’s Economics Department. </p>
      <p>In his free time, Carlyle is an avid Yelper and owner of a scented candle review blog. He is passionate about theatre and music, thoroughly enjoying the availability of high-quality performances in his new home. On a typical Friday Night, you’ll probably find him discovering new artists on Spotify and debating his friends about politics. </p>

      <p> Carlyle was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. With a deep reverence for hospitality but a lack of the characteristic Southern accent, he cites his upbringing in the “New South” as a major influence on his interests in racial justice and urban development. Carlyle is a proud graduate of Myers Park High School, a well-regarded public school that was also attended by his grandmother. There he obtained his International Baccalaureate Diploma, graduating in the top 3% of his class of over 700 students.</p>
      <p> During his eighteen years of living in Charlotte, Carlyle was able to watch his hometown grow exponentially in both population and size. Growing up a block away from a historically African-American working class neighborhood, Carlyle also saw the negative implications of Charlotte’s growth. He watched the character of said neighborhood transform with gentrification, affordable housing being replaced by properties catering to upper-middle class professionals looking for a shorter commute. In Spring of his sophomore year of high school, Carlyle used list price information from his local Registrar of Deeds to research changes in housing prices within the neighborhood, identifying the developers that were primarily responsible for the neighborhood’s changes. Using information from the archives of his local library system, he constructed a photographic report that showcased the violation of commitments made by these developers to provide affordable housing. The report also featured crudely created maps put together using Google Maps and Microsoft Paint, Carlyle’s first venture into statistical cartography.</p>
      <p> After completing this project, Carlyle stepped back from his research to focus on developing his technical skills. Assisted by open-source software, he taught himself QGIS mapping software and the R statistical programming language. He became interested in machine learning and predictive modeling, taking online coursework on modeling in R and Python. These new skills were invaluable in completing the capstone project of his International Baccalaureate Diploma, a research paper focused on evaluating the socioeconomic effects of a commuter rail system in the Charlotte Neighborhood of South End.</p>
      <p> Deciding that a more sophisticated background in economics and statistics was necessary, Carlyle thought that a college education would be a logical next step. When applying to school, Carlyle prioritized institutions that would allow him to pursue his research interests in urban and international economic growth. Attracted by its ambitious student body and Data Science Institute, Carlyle committed to Columbia University and moved to the Upper West Side in New York City, where he currently resides. At Columbia, Carlyle currently sits on the editorial board of the Journal of Politics and Society, a research journal publishing extraordinary social science research by undergraduates from around the world. He is also in the onboarding process for a Research Assistant position within Columbia’s Economics Department. </p>
      <p>In his free time, Carlyle is an avid Yelper and owner of a scented candle review blog. He is passionate about theatre and music, thoroughly enjoying the availability of high-quality performances in his new home. On a typical Friday Night, you’ll probably find him discovering new artists on Spotify and debating his friends about politics. </p>

<h1> S. Carlyle Morgan </h1>
    <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p> I'm currently a first-year student at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/"> Columbia University</a> studying statistics, computer science, and economics.
      My work focuses on the usage of statistical techniques to improve public policy. My current research interests include the effects of accumulating sovereign debt on developing economies,
      effects of public transportation development on housing markets and urban renewal, and the financial aspects of fixing America's aging energy infastructure.</p>
